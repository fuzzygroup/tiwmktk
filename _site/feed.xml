        <title>Dear Asshole Son</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Asshole Son,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to start by defusing “asshole” and tell you that I love you – more than you can know  – until you have kids of your own.  I have loved you since 2003 but, right now, you are in the throes of a rebellious teenage-hood and you are being an asshole.  In specific we have a tragedy of the commons thing going on right in our home.  This requires a definition and I’m going to turn to Wikipedia and the philosopher &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrett_Hardin&quot;&gt;Garret Hardin&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tragedy of the commons is a situation in a shared-resource system where individual users, acting independently according to their own self-interest, behave contrary to the common good of all users, by depleting or spoiling that resource through their collective action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons#targetText=The%20tragedy%20of%20the%20commons,resource%20through%20their%20collective%20action.&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I’m talking about, of course, is your use of the family home – and treating me, your mom and your brother as your servants to pick up after you.  I am not your damn main, I am not your damn butler; I will be your cook tho - ;-).  What you are doing right now is abusing your family and our “commons” (the home we all live in).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here are the rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you use a fork, a dish, a pan, a glass, etc - you are going to wash it right that moment.  There are to be no more dishes left behind.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You are to keep your stuff in your room.  Any of your things that I find lying around (say your sunglasses, your Airpods, your iPhone charger), I will confiscate and keep until you learn your lesson.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You are to confine your bedroom activities to &lt;strong&gt;YOUR DAMN BEDROOM&lt;/strong&gt;.  If I ever find a used condom of yours anywhere in my damn house, well, I will seek revenge in the form of humiliating your whenever I see fit.  I have no problem finding you at your workplace, your school environment or in front of your girlfriend and handing her your used condom.   Don’t push me on this issue; you know I’m good for it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you are going to be out all night then I expect a text message sent to your mom and myself before we wake up and find you missing.  And if we do find you missing then I will immediately begin a call chain that will begin with your girlfriend’s parents, your girlfriend and then yourself.  I’m sure her father would love to know that at 4 am I don’t know where my son (his daughter’s boyfriend) is – but that I think you too are together.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you put stuff in the trash can and its full then empty it and put new bags in.  Again I am not the damn butler.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know you will get past this stage but right now things aren’t good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all my love,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dad&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Twelve Rules for Your First Job</title>
        <description>My eldest son just got his first job (ok his second job but this is the first one that counts). He is in a customer facing service technician role and this is the advice that I wish had been given to me when I got my first job:

1. Never swear at least where a customer can hear.
2. Be respectful to your boss.
3. Google your boss before you start; information is power.
4. Be on time; be early if you can.
5. Be prepared.
6. Work hard.
7. Be kind to customers; be even kinder to your co workers.
8. Dress fitting the needs of the job.
9. Be humble with your coworkers.
10. Accept responsibility when you make a mistake.
11. Pay attention and notice things.
12. Nothing can ever be too clean 

A few clarifications:

* My first job was working for the family business and I remember, 39 years later, my Dad dressing me down when I swore in front of a customer (mind you I was maybe 12 and struggling to load a 70 plus pound bucket of drive way sealer into the trunk of their car without any help; no matter, I was **absolutely in the wrong**).
* Customers come and go but your coworkers are there day in and day out; being kind to customers but rotten to your coworkers will hurt you.
* Dress is something that is highly tied to the job.  If you work in front of a customer, neat and clean is generally the rule but it varies widely -- if you work in an adult bookstore, for example, cleavage is the rule not the exception.
* Paying attention in work (and in life) really, really matters.  If you make a conscious effort to notice things, you'll be amazed at what you can learn.
* In terms of things never being too clean, if you really want to impress your boss, make a concerted effort to keep things clean.  Trust me -- your boss will notice; they always notice this.
