    <p>My eldest son just got his first job (ok his second job but this is the first one that counts). He is in a customer facing service technician role and this is the advice that I wish had been given to me when I got my first job:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Never swear at least where a customer can hear.</li>
  <li>Be respectful to your boss.</li>
  <li>Google your boss before you start; information is power.</li>
  <li>Be on time; be early if you can.</li>
  <li>Be prepared.</li>
  <li>Work hard.</li>
  <li>Be kind to customers; be even kinder to your co workers.</li>
  <li>Dress fitting the needs of the job.</li>
  <li>Be humble with your coworkers.</li>
  <li>Accept responsibility when you make a mistake.</li>
  <li>Pay attention and notice things.</li>
  <li>Nothing can ever be too clean</li>
</ol>

<p>A few clarifications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>My first job was working for the family business and I remember, 39 years later, my Dad dressing me down when I swore in front of a customer (mind you I was maybe 12 and struggling to load a 70 plus pound bucket of drive way sealer into the trunk of their car without any help; no matter, I was <strong>absolutely in the wrong</strong>).</li>
  <li>Customers come and go but your coworkers are there day in and day out; being kind to customers but rotten to your coworkers will hurt you.</li>
  <li>Dress is something that is highly tied to the job.  If you work in front of a customer, neat and clean is generally the rule but it varies widely – if you work in an adult bookstore, for example, cleavage is the rule not the exception.</li>
  <li>Paying attention in work (and in life) really, really matters.  If you make a conscious effort to notice things, you’ll be amazed at what you can learn.</li>
  <li>In terms of things never being too clean, if you really want to impress your boss, make a concerted effort to keep things clean.  Trust me – your boss will notice; they always notice this.</li>
</ul>
