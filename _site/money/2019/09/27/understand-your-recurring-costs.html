    <p>I had to drive my son to work this morning and as he came down, I was in the kitchen making Strawberry Tequila for my wife.  As I watched him shuffle about, it occurred to me:</p>

<ul>
  <li>My son lives at home but he works away from the home</li>
  <li>For him all food – from home – is <strong>free</strong></li>
  <li>I’ve never seen him pack a lunch</li>
</ul>

<p>“Alex – what do you do for lunch?” was my question.  “Usually McDonald’s or Taco Bell; about $10” was his answer.</p>

<p>My immediate thought was “Oy Vey”.  I said to him “Ok.  That’s $50 / week.  What is $50 * 50 (number of weeks in a year)”.  A bit of math struggles ensued and then we came to $2,500 as the correct answer.  My next question to him was</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What could you spend $2,500 on that you’d prefer to old McDonald’s wrappers?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then I brought up a discussion of recurring costs.  Recurring costs are those costs which, well, occur over and over – they <strong>recur</strong>.  Whenever I look at money, I tend to worry about recurring costs because they never go away.  I could tell my son was unconvinced so I then asked him:</p>

<p>“How many weeks have you worked?”</p>

<p>“4”</p>

<p>“Ok that’s $200.  Is there anything you’d rather have done with that $200”</p>

<p>I suspect that my son won’t actually start making his lunch now but perhaps I’ve planted a seed for the future.</p>

<h2 id="postscript">Postscript</h2>

<p>In the ensuing weeks, I watched my son start to make his own lunch.  And while I suspect it was more due to lack of cash than full agreement with his Dad, I’ll take the win and feel at least moderately ok about it.</p>
