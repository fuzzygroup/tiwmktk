John Donne once famously wrote: 

> 'No Man is an Island'
No man is an island entire of itself; every man 
is a piece of the continent, a part of the main; 
if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe 
is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as 
well as any manner of thy friends or of thine 
own were; any man's death diminishes me, 
because I am involved in mankind. 
And therefore never send to know for whom 
the bell tolls; it tolls for thee. 

As I write this for my sons, I am 51 years old and it feels like I've only learned this lesson in the past year or so.  The lesson is simple and it is the title of this essay: "Get the Hell Involved In Your Community".  I don't care what you do in the world, no matter how esoteric your interests are, there is a community for it.  That community might be in the real world or it might be online.  But there is a community for it.  

I'm going to give two example of getting involved:

* I recently moved my daily programming language from 100% ruby to 75% ruby and 25% python and one of the first things I did was go and find a python meetup group, IndyPy, as a community of people from which to learn.  At the very first meeting, they asked for someone to speak on security in an Amazon Web Services context and I ended up giving a presentation at the next meeting.
* Our local city has an annual science fiction convention, Starbase Indy.  In November of 2018, I donated a large number of books to their auction.  This brought me in contact with the organizers, who have become some of my best friends.  And now, a year later, I am Head of Engineering for Starbase Indy.  Over the past year, I've made a ton of friends, worked really hard and had a great time.

And here is the truth that even myself, a hard core introvert, will admit: **Community makes your life richer**.
