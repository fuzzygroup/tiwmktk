John Donne once famously wrote: 

> 'No Man is an Island'
No man is an island entire of itself; every man 
is a piece of the continent, a part of the main; 
if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe 
is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as 
well as any manner of thy friends or of thine 
own were; any man's death diminishes me, 
because I am involved in mankind. 
And therefore never send to know for whom 
the bell tolls; it tolls for thee. 

As I write this for my sons, I am 51 years old and it feels like I've only learned this lesson in the past year or so.  The lesson is simple and it is the title of this essay: "Get the Hell Involved In Your Community".  I don't care what you do in the world, no matter how esoteric your interests are, there is a community for it.

I'm going to give an example of getting involved.  I recently moved my daily programming language from 100% ruby to 75% ruby and 25% python and one of the first things I did was go and find a python meetup group, IndyPy, as a community of people from which to learn.
