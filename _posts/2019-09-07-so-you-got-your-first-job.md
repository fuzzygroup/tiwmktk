My eldest son just got his first job (ok his second job but this is the first one that counts). He is in a customer facing service technician role and this is the advice that I wish had been given to me when I got my first job:

1. Never swear at least where a customer can hear.
2. Be respectful to your boss.
3. Google your boss before you start; information is power.
4. Be on time; be early if you can.
5. Be prepared.
6. Work hard.
7. Be kind to customers; be even kinder to your co workers.
8. Dress fitting the needs of the job.
9. Be humble with your coworkers.
10. Accept responsibility when you make a mistake.
11. Pay attention and notice things.
12. Nothing can ever be too clean 

A few clarifications:

* My first job was working for the family business and I remember, 39 years later, my Dad dressing me down when I swore in front of a customer (mind you I was maybe 12 and struggling to load a 70 plus pound bucket of drive way sealer into the trunk of their car without any help; no matter, I was **absolutely in the wrong**).
* Customers come and go but your coworkers are there day in and day out; being kind to customers but rotten to your coworkers will hurt you.
* Dress is something that is highly tied to the job.  If you work in front of a customer, neat and clean is generally the rule but it varies widely -- if you work in an adult bookstore, for example, cleavage is the rule not the exception.
* Paying attention in work (and in life) really, really matters.  If you make a conscious effort to notice things, you'll be amazed at what you can learn.
* In terms of things never being too clean, if you really want to impress your boss, make a concerted effort to keep things clean.  Trust me -- your boss will notice; they always notice this.
