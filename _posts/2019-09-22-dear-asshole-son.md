Dear Asshole Son, 

I want to start by defusing "asshole" and tell you that I love you -- more than you can know  -- until you have kids of your own.  I have loved you since 2003 but, right now, you are in the throes of a rebellious teenage-hood and you are being an asshole.  In specific we have a tragedy of the commons thing going on right in our home.  This requires a definition and I'm going to turn to Wikipedia and the philosopher [Garret Hardin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrett_Hardin):

> The tragedy of the commons is a situation in a shared-resource system where individual users, acting independently according to their own self-interest, behave contrary to the common good of all users, by depleting or spoiling that resource through their collective action.
  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons#targetText=The%20tragedy%20of%20the%20commons,resource%20through%20their%20collective%20action.)
  
What I'm talking about, of course, is your use of the family home -- and treating me, your mom and your brother as your servants to pick up after you.  I am not your damn main, I am not your damn butler; I will be your cook tho - ;-).  What you are doing right now is abusing your family and our "commons" (the home we all live in).  

So here are the rules:

* If you use a fork, a dish, a pan, a glass, etc - you are going to wash it right that moment.  There are to be no more dishes left behind.
* You are to keep your stuff in your room.  Any of your things that I find lying around (say your sunglasses, your Airpods, your iPhone charger), I will confiscate and keep until you learn your lesson.
* You are to confine your bedroom activities to **YOUR DAMN BEDROOM**.  If I ever find a used condom of yours anywhere in my damn house, well, I will seek revenge in the form of humiliating your whenever I see fit.  I have no problem finding you at your workplace, your school environment or in front of your girlfriend and handing her your used condom.   Don't push me on this issue; you know I'm good for it.  And to be clear, I'm not saying don't use condoms - absolutely use condoms - but just as you wouldn't want proof that Mom and Dad are doing it, we don't want proof that you are doing it.
* If you are going to be out all night then I expect a text message sent to your mom and myself before we wake up and find you missing.  And if we do find you missing then I will immediately begin a call chain that will begin with your friends, your girlfriend and then yourself.  
* If you put stuff in the trash can and its full then empty it and put new bags in.  Again I am not the damn butler.

I know you will get past this stage but right now things aren't good.

With all my love, 

Dad
