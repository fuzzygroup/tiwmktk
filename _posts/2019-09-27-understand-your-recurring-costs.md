I had to drive my son to work this morning and as he came down, I was in the kitchen making Strawberry Tequila.  As I watched him shuffle about, it occurred to me:

* My son lives at home
* For him all food -- from home -- is free
* I've never seen him pack a lunch

"Alex -- what do you do for lunch?" was my question.  "Usually McDonald's or Taco Bell; about $10" was his answer.  

My immediate thought was "Oy Vey".  I said to him "Ok.  That's $50 / week.  What is $50 * 50 (number of weeks in a year)".  A bit of math struggles ensued and then we came to $2,500 as the correct answer.  My next question to him was 

> What could you spend $2,500 on that you'd prefer to old McDonald's wrappers?

And then I brought up a discussion of recurring costs.  Recurring costs are those costs which, well, occur over and over -- they recur.  Whenever I look at money, I tend to worry about recurring costs because they never go away.  I could tell my son was unconvinced so I then asked him:

"How many weeks have you worked?" 

"4"

"Ok that's $200.  Is there anything you'd rather have done with that $200"

I suspect that my son won't actually start making his lunch now but perhaps I've planted a seed for the future.
